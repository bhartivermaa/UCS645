Q1. DAXPY Loop
Operation performed in each iteration: X[i] = a * X[i] + Y[i]
Results:
Threads	Time (seconds)
4	0.001364
8	0.001849
12	0.010231
>12	0.018478

Observation:
The minimum execution time was obtained with 4 threads, so the maximum speedup is achieved at 4 threads.

Reason:
After a certain point, increasing the number of threads increases overhead due to thread scheduling, synchronization, and memory contention. Hence, performance degrades instead of improving.System has 12 threads.

Q2. Matrix Multiplication
Two parallel versions were implemented:

1D Threading: Only the outer loop was parallelized.
2D Threading: Two nested loops were parallelized using collapse(2).

Observation:
The 2D threaded version was faster than the 1D version because work was distributed more evenly among threads.

Reason:
In 2D threading, more independent operations run in parallel, reducing idle time of threads and improving load balance.

Q3. Calculation of π

The value of π was calculated using numerical integration and parallel reduction.
Output:  Pi = 3.1415926536

Observation:
The parallel implementation significantly reduces execution time compared to the serial version.

Reason:
The loop iterations are divided among multiple threads, and partial results are combined using the reduction clause.
