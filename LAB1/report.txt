System has 12 threads.

Q1 DAXPY:
The best performance was achieved with 4 threads.
Beyond 4 threads, execution time increased due to thread management overhead and memory contention.
Hence, increasing threads beyond optimal point does not always improve performance.

Q2 Matrix:
2D threading performed better than 1D.

Q3 Pi:
Parallel version is faster than serial.
